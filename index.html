        Representatives of 140 nations signed the Geneva Climate Compact yesterday,
        committing to net-zero carbon emissions by 2045. The ceremony marks the end
        of three years of difficult negotiations and is being called the most significant
        diplomatic achievement of the decade.
      </p>
      <p>
        The accord also creates a $280 billion annual fund to help developing countries
        transition to clean energy, a key demand of the Global South bloc.

        The National Weather Service issued an early warning yesterday for residents
        from Maine to Florida to begin preparing for a severe storm season. Three named
        systems have already formed in the Atlantic — six weeks ahead of schedule.
      </p>
      <p>
        Emergency declarations have been issued in four states, and federal officials
        are reviewing coastal infrastructure standards ahead of the expected peak months.

      <p>
        Researchers at the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics confirmed the
        discovery of an Earth-sized exoplanet orbiting within the habitable zone of a
        nearby star, reigniting debate about the possibility of life beyond our solar system.
      </p>
      <p>
        The planet, designated Kepler-1649f, sits at a distance from its star that could
        allow liquid water to exist on the surface — a key ingredient for life as we know it.
